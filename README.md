# JustClothing :dress:

## Project Overview
JustClothing is a prototype for an eCommerce clothing application, built using React JS. The application is based off of a Udemy tutorial by the Zero to Mastery Academy which can be accessed [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/). This was developed as part of my **365 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Initial Work
The initial work is still underway, but currently the application uses React, Redux, Firebase and the Stripe API.
